The LUWRAIN platform

LUWRAIN is a platform designed for the creation of apps for
the blind and partially sighted. It provides the platform
core, a set of standard controls, the JavaScript engine and
various utilities for integration of apps to services over
the Internet. The apps are supposed to be written in Java or
JavaScript. LUWRAIN is implemented in Java with our support
of running under Microsoft Windows and GNU/Linux.

How to compile LUWRAIN

We maintain a set of scripts for GNU/Linux which make
the compilation process very easy. In order to run them, 
you must use any GNU/Linux distro (tested with Ubuntu 16.04),
Java 1.8 or higher and ANT utility.

1. Go to base/scripts
2. Run ./lwr-prepare
3. Run ./lwr-build 

After that you should have all Java binaries compiled.
However, LUWRAIN is usually use some JNI-libraries, which
must be compiled separately.
